# The Hands-Free Music Project

Our project aims to enable people with limited mobility, specifically people living with ALS, to be able to create music.  We want people who only have the use of their eyes to create music in real-time so that they have more ways to express themselves artistically.

## Who We Are

### Cole French
I'm an Informatics senior on the Data Science track. Before I began pursuing a career in tech, I had a passion for teaching and learning sciences â€“ or studying how we learn. I soon realized how technology can often not work for students in the classroom, and so I switched majors to work on improving accessibility and user experience for all. I look forward to seeing where this project goes and how it can impact the growing realm of music tech!
